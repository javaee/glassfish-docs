<a name="task-appredeploy"></a><h4>To Redeploy a Deployed Application</h4><p>Redeploying an application deploys a new version of the application while preserving the
settings and other options with which the application was originally deployed.</p><h6>Before You Begin</h6><p>Ensure that the application that you are redeploying is already deployed.</p><ol>
<li><b>In the navigation tree, select the Applications node.</b><p>The Applications page opens.</p></li>
<li><b>In the Deployed Applications table, click Redeploy in the row for the application
that you are redeploying.</b><p>The Redeploy Applications or Modules page opens.</p></li>
<li><b>If you require active sessions of the application to be preserved and then
restored when the redeployment is complete, select the Keep Sessions checkbox.</b><p>If any active session of the application fails to be preserved or restored,
<b>none</b> of the sessions will be available when the redeployment is complete. However,
the redeployment continues and a warning is logged.</p></li>
<li><b>Specify the location of the archive that contains the application to redeploy.</b><ul>
<li><b>If the archive is a file that resides on or is accessible
from the client machine, select the option Packaged File to Be Uploaded to
the Server.</b><p>The client machine is the host on which you are viewing the Administration
Console through a browser.</p><p>Click Browse to browse to the file, or type the full path
to the file.</p></li>
<li><b>If the archive is a file that resides on the server machine,
or is an unpackaged application from an exploded directory, select the option Local Packaged
File or Directory That Is Accessible From the Application Server.</b><p>The server machine is the host that is running the domain administration server
(DAS). </p><p>Click Browse Files to browse to a file, or Browse Folders to
browse to a directory. Alternatively, type the full path name to the file
or directory. Deploying from an exploded directory is for advanced developers and is
not recommended for production environments.</p></li></ul></li>
