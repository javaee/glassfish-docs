<a name="ref-serverinstappsconfig"></a><h4>Applications Configuration</h4>
<p>Use the Applications Configuration page to set properties that help ensure that changes
to deployed applications are detected and that the modified classes are reloaded.</p><p>The Applications Configuration page contains the following options.</p><dl><dt>Reload</dt>
<dd><p>If this option is enabled, modified classes are reloaded dynamically. The server periodically checks for changes in the deployment directory and redeploys the application, automatically and dynamically, with the changes. This is useful in a development environment, because it allows code changes to be tested quickly. In a production environment, however, dynamic reloading might degrade performance. In addition, whenever a reload is done, the sessions at that transit time become invalid. The client must restart the session.</p></dd>
<dt>Reload Poll Interval</dt>
<dd><p>Identifies how often the server should check for changes in the deployed applications.</p></dd>
<dt>Admin Session Timeout</dt>
<dd><p>Identifies the number of minutes of inactivity before the Administration Console times out and you have to log in again.</p></dd>
<dt>Auto Deploy</dt>
<dd><p>If this option is enabled, applications in the auto-deploy directory are deployed automatically.</p></dd>
<dt>Auto Deploy Poll Interval</dt>
<dd><p>Specifies how often the server should check the auto-deploy directory for application or module archives. Changing the poll interval does not affect the time taken for deploying an application or module.</p></dd>
<dt>Auto Deploy Retry Timeout</dt>
<dd><p>Specifies the number of seconds that a partially copied file can remain unchanged in size before an error occurs. The default value is 30.</p><p>If a file is copied slowly into the auto-deploy directory, the file can appear before the entire file is copied. As a result, the attempt to automatically deploy the application fails. If an attempt to automatically deploy an application fails for this reason, the Enterprise Server tries to deploy the application again. If the size of the partially copied file remains unchanged for the specified period of time, an error occurs.</p></dd>
<dt>Auto Deploy Directory</dt>
<dd><p>Identifies the directory to monitor for automatic deployment of applications.</p></dd>
<dt>Verifier</dt>
<dd><p>If this option is enabled, the verifier is run before deployment. The verifier examines the structure and content of the file. Verification of large applications is often time-consuming.</p></dd>
<dt>Precompile</dt>
<dd><p>If this option is enabled, JavaServer Pages<sup>TM</sup> (JSP<sup>TM</sup>) files are precompiled. If this option is disabled, JSP files are compiled at runtime when they are first accessed.</p></dd>
<dt>Additional Properties</dt>
<dd><p>Additional properties for applications. The Enterprise Server does not define any additional properties for applications.</p></dd>
