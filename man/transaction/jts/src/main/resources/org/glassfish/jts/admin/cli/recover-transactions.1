asadmin Utility Subcommands               recover-transactions(1)

NAME
     recover transactions - manually  recovers  pending  transac-
     tions

SYNOPSIS
     recover-transactions  [--help] [--txlogdir transaction_log_dir ]
     [--destination destination_server_name ] server_name

DESCRIPTION
     The recover-transactions subcommand manually recovers  pend-
     ing transactions.

     For a standalone server,  do  not  use  this  subcommand  to
     recover  transactions  after  a  server failure. For a stan-
     dalone  server,  the  recover-transactions  subcommand   can
     recover  transactions  only  when  a resource fails, but the
     server is still running. If a standalone server fails,  only
     the  full  startup recovery process can recover transactions
     that were pending when the server failed.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --transactionlogdir
         Do not specify this option. This option  is  valid  only
         for an installation of multiple server instances. If you
         specify this option for a standalone  server,  an  error
         occurs.

         The location of the transaction logs  for  a  particular
         server.  When  a  server fails it writes the location in
         its transaction log.

         If the failed server's transaction logs  are  copied  to
         some  other  location to make it available to the surro-
         gate recovery server, use this option to specify the new
         location of the transaction logs. If the failed server's
         transaction service tx-log-dir property is  modified  to
         reflect   a  new  location,  then  this  option  is  not
         required.

     --destination

         Do not specify this option. This option  is  valid  only
         for an installation of multiple server instances. If you
         specify this option for a standalone  server,  an  error
         occurs.

         The destination server that will  perform  the  recovery
         for  the  server  that  is  specified by the server_name
         operand. The destination server should be running.

OPERANDS
     server_name
         For a standalone server, the value of  this  operand  is
         typically  server.  Transactions are recovered only if a
         resource fails, but the server is still running.
